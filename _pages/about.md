Hello! I'm Leslie, I've recently graduated from the Data Science and Machine Learning program offered by [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com). 

Since late 2020, I have been committed to learning SQL, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning. I quit my full-time job in March of this year so that I could go back to school and fully immerse myself in my studies. For the past several months, I was in class remotely, Monday through Friday. Now, I'm on the hunt for a job! 

When I'm not programming or studying, you can find me hiking, sport climbing, or stand up paddle boarding!

 I am currently in Denver, CO

 April 18 - March 22:    Chattanooga, Tennessee  
 March 23 - September 10:     Denver, Colorado  
 Next destination: LA, California
