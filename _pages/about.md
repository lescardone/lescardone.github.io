Hello! I'm Leslie, a student enrolled in the Data Science and Machine Learning program offered by [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com). 

Since late 2020, I have been committed to learning SQL, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning. I quit my full-time job in March of this year so that I could go back to school and fully immerse myself in my studies. Currently, I am in class remotely, Monday through Friday. When I'm not doing coursework, you can find me hiking, sport climbing, or stand up paddle boarding!

 I am currently road tripping with a good friend of mine.

 April 18 - March 22:    Chattanooga, Tennessee  
 March 23 - July 23:     Denver, Colorado  
 Next destination:       TBD!
